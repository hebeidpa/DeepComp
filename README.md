**## DeepComp model**
An Interpretable Deep Learning Model for Preoperative Prediction of Postoperative Complications in Gastric Cancer 
**## Overview**
#This project mainly covers two core modules:
-GastricNN-UNet: A nnU-Net-based CT segmentation model for gastric medical imaging.
-FT-transformer: A pipeline for constructing DeepComp models from medical data and gastric medical imaging.
**#GastricNN-UNet**
GastricNN-UNet A customized implementation of the nnU-Net framework for 3D CT image segmentation focusing on gastric structures. Key features:
Preprocessing pipelines optimized for abdominal CT scans
Configuration files for gastric organ/tumor segmentation
Trained model weights (optional, contact for access)
